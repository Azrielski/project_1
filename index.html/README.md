H1- I decided to Use H1 as the first and main heading of the Topic "Ugali" this is because the H1 element is has the biggest font out of H1-H6 making it fit for the main Header of the topic.

H2- I Used H2 for the subtopics, and this because H2 has a smaller font size than H1 making it better to use for subtopics

P- Used after the element H1 and H2 to to be arranged as the storyline under the topic 

ol- used when i listed the countries that have their own type of ugali because the list was in the  alphabetical order

li- Used under the ul and ol to list the items under the ol and ul

ul- Used to list the the unordered lists that under "what is Ugali eaten with" due to the fact that there is no specific order in the list.
white
img - by the use of src linking the downloaded image to the html to view it on the browser

style- used under the elements ul, ol, p.. to edit the font size of the content in the elements to be more clear.
